## Problem Introduction: 
Two of India's biggest stock exchanges BSE and NSE, collectively clear trades combining to greater than 40,000 crores every day. As you might already be aware, a lot of trading happens on the basis of technical and fundamental analysis.

## Objective:
The objective of this assignment is to determine which stocks can be bought/sold/held based on the moving averages calculated for a period of 20 days [short term] to 50 days [long term].

## Results Expected:
1. Create a new table named 'bajaj1' containing the date, close price, 20 Day MA and 50 Day MA. (This has to be done for all 6 stocks)

2. Create a master table containing the date and close price of all the six stocks. (Column header for the price is the name of the stock)

3. Use the table created in Part(1) to generate buy and sell signal. Store this in another table named 'bajaj2'. Perform this operation for all stocks.

4. Create a User defined function, that takes the date as input and returns the signal for that particular day (Buy/Sell/Hold) for the Bajaj stock.

5. Write a brief summary of the results obtained and what inferences you can draw from the analysis performed. (Less than 250 words to be submitted in a pdf file)
